/* ### Mobile-first Design
Mobile-first design is an approach where designing and developing start with the smallest screen size, and then progressively enhance for larger screens.

- **Example**: */
  body {
    background-color: lightgray; /* Default styles for mobile */
  }
  
  @media (min-width: 600px) {
    body {
      background-color: lightblue; /* Styles for larger screens */
    }
  }

/* This approach ensures that the website is optimized for mobile devices before adapting to larger screens, ensuring a better user experience across all devices. */
