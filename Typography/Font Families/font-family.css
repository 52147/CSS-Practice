/* "Sans-serif" refers to a category of typefaces that do not have the small projecting features called "serifs" at the ends of strokes. Sans-serif fonts are often used for their clean, modern look and are popular for both web and print design.

Characteristics of Sans-Serif Fonts
No Serifs: Unlike serif fonts, which have small lines or extensions at the end of strokes, sans-serif fonts are characterized by the absence of these features.
Modern and Clean: Sans-serif fonts are often perceived as more modern and cleaner than serif fonts, making them popular in contemporary design.
Versatility: They are versatile and can be used in various contexts, from body text to headlines.
Examples of Sans-Serif Fonts

Helvetica
Verdana

Futura
Gill Sans
Usage in CSS
You can specify a sans-serif font in your CSS by listing the font family and providing "sans-serif" as a fallback:  */

/* "Serif" refers to a category of typefaces that have small lines or strokes regularly attached to the end of a larger stroke in a letter or symbol. These lines or strokes are known as "serifs."

Characteristics of Serif Fonts
Serifs: The defining feature of serif fonts is the small decorative lines at the ends of the characters.
Traditional and Formal: Serif fonts are often associated with tradition and formality, making them popular in print media such as books, newspapers, and magazines.
Readability: The serifs can help guide the eye along the lines of text, which can enhance readability, especially in long passages of text.
