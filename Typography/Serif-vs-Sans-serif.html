<!-- "Sans-serif" refers to a category of typefaces that do not have the small projecting features called "serifs" at the ends of strokes. Sans-serif fonts are often used for their clean, modern look and are popular for both web and print design.

Characteristics of Sans-Serif Fonts
No Serifs: Unlike serif fonts, which have small lines or extensions at the end of strokes, sans-serif fonts are characterized by the absence of these features.
Modern and Clean: Sans-serif fonts are often perceived as more modern and cleaner than serif fonts, making them popular in contemporary design.
Versatility: They are versatile and can be used in various contexts, from body text to headlines.

Usage in CSS
