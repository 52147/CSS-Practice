/* Positioning
CSS positioning properties are used to position elements. */

/* Static
The default position; elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document. */
div {
  position: static;
}

/* Relative
Positioned relative to its normal position. */
div {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}
/* Absolute
Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). */
div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 30px;
  left: 40px;
}

/* Fixed
Positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. */
div {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 10px;
  right: 10px;
}

/* Sticky
A hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified point, then it is treated as fixed positioned. */
div {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}
